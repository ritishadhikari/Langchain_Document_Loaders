       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\letters\\\\sj.txt'}, page_content='I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.\\n\\nThe first story is about connecting the dots.\\n\\nI dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?\\n\\nIt started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\\n\\nAnd 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:\\n\\nReed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.\\n\\nNone of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.\\n\\nAgain, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\\n\\nMy second story is about love and loss.\\n\\nI was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\\n\\nI really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\\n\\nI didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\\n\\nDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\\n\\nI’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.\\n\\nMy third story is about death.\\n\\nWhen I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\\n\\nRemembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\\n\\nI lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.\\n\\nThis was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\\n\\nNo one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\\n\\nYour time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\\n\\nWhen I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\\n\\nStewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\\n\\nStay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\\n\\nThank you all very much.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\letters\\\\paul_graham_essay.txt'}, page_content='What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\\n\\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\\n\\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he\\'d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\\n\\nThough I liked programming, I didn\\'t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn\\'t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\\n\\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\\n\\nThere weren\\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\\n\\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\\n\\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\\n\\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\\n\\nI don\\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\\'s told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\\n\\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\\'s a subset of natural language that\\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\\n\\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\\n\\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.\\n\\nThe problem with systems work, though, was that it didn\\'t last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\\n\\nThere were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\\n\\nI wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.\\n\\nIn this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I\\'d spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn\\'t become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\\n\\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn\\'t have a boss, or even need to get research funding.\\n\\nI had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I\\'d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn\\'t just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\\n\\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\\n\\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\\n\\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I\\'ll give you something to read in a few days.\"\\n\\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There\\'s a whole world there that\\'s barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\\n\\nI\\'d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\\n\\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they\\'d sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I\\'d done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.\\n\\nOnly stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don\\'t know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]\\n\\nI\\'m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn\\'t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn\\'t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they\\'d seen in American art magazines.\\n\\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She\\'d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he\\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\\n\\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can\\'t move. People can\\'t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don\\'t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you\\'re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you\\'re seeing. You don\\'t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it\\'s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it\\'s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]\\n\\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\\'t consciously aware of much we\\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that\\'s a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that\\'s a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\\n\\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\\'m not 100% sure it\\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.\\n\\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn\\'t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\\n\\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]\\n\\nInterleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they\\'d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I\\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn\\'t know C and didn\\'t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\\n\\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.\\n\\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it\\'s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it\\'s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there\\'s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\\n\\nBut the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\\'s good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\\n\\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.\\n\\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\\'s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\\'s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That\\'s not always why artists have a signature style, but it\\'s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]\\n\\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\\n\\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]\\n\\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there\\'s a tiny corner that\\'s not rich, or at least wasn\\'t in 1993. It\\'s called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist — in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\\n\\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn\\'t want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\\n\\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I\\'d taken her painting class at Harvard. I\\'ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\\n\\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\\'t I become rich? Then I\\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\\n\\nMeanwhile I\\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\\n\\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\\'t want to be online, and still don\\'t, not the fancy ones. That\\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\\n\\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.\\n\\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.\\n\\nWe were working out of Robert\\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\\'d never have to write anything to run on users\\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\\'t need anything more than a browser.\\n\\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\\n\\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\\n\\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\\'d needed it ourselves.\\n\\nAt this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I\\'d made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.\\n\\nWe originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.\\n\\nIt helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.\\n\\n(If you\\'re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it\\'s because it\\'s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)\\n\\nIn September, Robert rebelled. \"We\\'ve been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it\\'s still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.\\n\\nIt was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They\\'re the two most independent-minded people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm\\'s brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor\\'s it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.\\n\\nWe opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\\n\\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn\\'t have to integrate with any other software except Robert\\'s and Trevor\\'s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I\\'d had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\\n\\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn\\'t because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\\n\\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what\\'s now called \"doing things that don\\'t scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we\\'re driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d\\'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.\\n\\nWe learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man\\'s shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men\\'s shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.\\n\\nThough this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we\\'d have so many users that I couldn\\'t scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\\n\\nAnother thing I didn\\'t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that\\'s how much money you\\'re making, and if you\\'re not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we\\'d been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you\\'re doing fine. You\\'re growing 7x a year. Just don\\'t hire too many more people and you\\'ll soon be profitable, and then you\\'ll control your own destiny.\\n\\nAlas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that\\'s what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn\\'t reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.\\n\\nIt was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn\\'t feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.\\n\\nThe next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn\\'t realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo\\'s prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.\\n\\nYahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they\\'d never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I\\'d painted anything that I\\'d half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men\\'s shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\\n\\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.\\n\\nBut I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I\\'d already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That\\'s what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.\\n\\nSo I tried to paint, but I just didn\\'t seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn\\'t know many people in California. I\\'d compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you\\'ll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn\\'t know any of them.\\n\\nWhen I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn\\'t been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I\\'d paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn\\'t rotted yet).\\n\\nMeanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn\\'t one. Huh.\\n\\nAround this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.\\n\\nI got so excited about this idea that I couldn\\'t think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn\\'t particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he\\'d made a lot of money the last time I\\'d lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.\\n\\nHmph. Well, I\\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\\'s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\\n\\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn\\'t last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.\\n\\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn\\'t want to run a company — especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I\\'d only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn\\'t need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I\\'d build a subset that could be done as an open source project.\\n\\nMuch to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.\\n\\nThe subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn\\'t even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\\n\\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we\\'d used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I\\'d created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]\\n\\nWow, I thought, there\\'s an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\\n\\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]\\n\\nIn the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]\\n\\nI\\'ve worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I\\'d always write essays too.\\n\\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they\\'d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.\\n\\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I\\'ve noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren\\'t prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I\\'m writing, and I explain that it\\'s an essay I\\'m going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.\\n\\nIt\\'s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it\\'s a sign both that there\\'s something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren\\'t prestigious doesn\\'t guarantee you\\'re on the right track, it at least guarantees you\\'re not on the most common type of wrong one.\\n\\nOver the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O\\'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.\\n\\nOne night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn\\'t know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn\\'t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.\\n\\nJessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\\n\\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\\n\\nOne of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won\\'t waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they\\'d be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we\\'d made.\\n\\nSo I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they\\'d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I\\'d only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I\\'d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn\\'t done one angel investment.\\n\\nMeanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.\\n\\nAs Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We\\'d start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we\\'d been talking about. I\\'d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we\\'d get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]\\n\\nOnce again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\\n\\nThere are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn\\'t figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn\\'t go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we\\'d been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.\\n\\nYC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn\\'t know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn\\'t have known where to start. [14]\\n\\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they\\'d start startups instead? We wouldn\\'t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn\\'t make much money out of it, we\\'d at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.\\n\\nWe\\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we\\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\\n\\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\\'d intended.\\n\\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\\n\\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\\n\\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\\n\\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\\'s intellectual curiosity.\\n\\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]\\n\\nAs well as HN, I wrote all of YC\\'s internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn\\'t have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\\n\\nYC was different from other kinds of work I\\'ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn\\'t have picked a better way to do it.\\n\\nThere were parts of the job I didn\\'t like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn\\'t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I\\'d better work very hard.\\n\\nOne day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn\\'t the last cool thing you do.\"\\n\\nAt the time I didn\\'t understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life\\'s work or I\\'d have to leave eventually. And it wasn\\'t, so I would.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\\n\\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn\\'t, so we decided we\\'d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn\\'t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we\\'d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\\n\\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he\\'d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\\n\\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\\n\\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I\\'m interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\\n\\nWhat should I do next? Rtm\\'s advice hadn\\'t included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I\\'d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\\n\\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I\\'d never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I\\'d always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven\\'t painted since. So far anyway.\\n\\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that\\'s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it\\'s getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\\n\\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren\\'t about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\\n\\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn\\'t originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what\\'s the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\\n\\nMcCarthy didn\\'t realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy\\'s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn\\'t match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn\\'t understand why at the time.\\n\\nMcCarthy\\'s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you\\'d want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren\\'t defined using McCarthy\\'s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn\\'t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you\\'d have had to run it, and computers then weren\\'t powerful enough.\\n\\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy\\'s axiomatic approach till you\\'d defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy\\'s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\\n\\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it\\'s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.\\n\\nI had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\\'s hard to keep track of what\\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\\n\\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I\\'d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"\\n\\nWorking on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy\\'s original Lisp, it\\'s a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy\\'s Lisp it\\'s a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I\\'d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who\\'d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It\\'s the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\\n\\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they\\'re willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\\n\\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore\\'s Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\\n\\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren\\'t specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\\n\\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn\\'t rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\\n\\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it\\'s done. But when the software is an online store builder and you\\'re hosting the stores, if you don\\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\\n\\n[9] We\\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\\n\\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\\n\\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\\n\\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\\n\\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\\n\\nHere\\'s an interesting point, though: you can\\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\\n\\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\\n\\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\\n\\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\\n\\n[15] I\\'ve never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\\n\\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\\n\\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\\'s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\\n\\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\letters\\\\churchill_speech.txt'}, page_content='Winston Churchill Speech - We Shall Fight on the Beaches\\n\\nWe Shall Fight on the Beaches\\n\\nJune 4, 1940\\n\\nHouse of Commons\\n\\nFrom the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the\\n\\nsecond week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and\\n\\nFrench Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was\\n\\nnot immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\\n\\nthe Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\\n\\ninvolved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\\n\\nabandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\\n\\npenetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\\n\\ncommand in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in\\n\\nBelgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly\\n\\ncreated French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\\n\\nHowever, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\\n\\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different\\n\\nkinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off\\n\\nall communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\\n\\nfood and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\\n\\nway up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and\\n\\nmechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there\\n\\nplodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people,\\n\\nalways so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\\n\\nhave never known in their own.\\n\\nI have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and\\n\\nCalais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\\n\\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\\n\\nVictoria\\'s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand\\n\\nstrong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned\\n\\nthe offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which\\n\\nmarked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the\\n\\nNavy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At\\n\\nleast two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British\\n\\nExpeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories\\n\\nof the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be\\n\\nheld by the French troops.\\n\\nThus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\\n\\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\\n\\nremained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\\n\\nsurrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were\\n\\npressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\\n\\nWhen, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\\n\\nfeared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I\\n\\nthought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the\\n\\nBritish Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field\\n\\nor else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\\n\\ntidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole\\n\\nroot and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to\\n\\nbuild, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or\\n\\nto be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\\n\\nThat was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to\\n\\nfall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and\\n\\nhis Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the\\n\\nlate war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and\\n\\nBritish Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at\\n\\nthe last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid,\\n\\nand even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong,\\n\\nguarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\\n\\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own\\n\\npersonal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed\\n\\nour whole flank and means of retreat.\\n\\nI asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not\\n\\nfeel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.\\n\\nThe surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the\\n\\nsea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared\\n\\nthe fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in\\n\\ndoing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see,\\n\\ncontact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army,\\n\\nwho were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of\\n\\nAllied troops could reach the coast.\\n\\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power\\n\\nof their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk\\n\\nand the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy\\n\\nbegan to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.\\n\\nThey sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft,\\n\\nsometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that\\n\\nremained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats,\\n\\none of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began.\\n\\nFor four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of\\n\\nthem-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve\\n\\nto embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They\\n\\nhad to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of\\n\\nbombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves\\n\\nfree from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little\\n\\nor no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing\\n\\nwith them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure\\n\\nof their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British\\n\\nand French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and\\n\\nwomen on board them never faltered in their duty.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range\\n\\nwould allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at\\n\\nthe German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was\\n\\nprotracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but\\n\\nonly for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by\\n\\nperfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to\\n\\nus all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly\\n\\nhandled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main\\n\\nstrength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the\\n\\nNavy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the\\n\\njaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must\\n\\nbe very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\\n\\nevacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by\\n\\nthe Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only\\n\\nthe bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much\\n\\ntalk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.\\n\\nThis was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a\\n\\ngreater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible,\\n\\nand to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have\\n\\nbeen an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war\\n\\nthan this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the\\n\\nArmy away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large\\n\\nformations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on\\n\\nseveral occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have\\n\\ndispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was\\n\\ndriven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more\\n\\nammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have\\n\\nbeen vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\\n\\nWhen we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island\\n\\nagainst an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and\\n\\nreassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army\\n\\nwas very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of\\n\\narmored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill\\n\\nand devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the\\n\\nhistory of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall\\n\\nback into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard\\n\\ntheir native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and\\n\\nshattering power, of whom it may be said that\\n\\nEvery morn brought forth a noble chance\\n\\nAnd every chance brought forth a noble knight,\\n\\ndeserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are\\n\\nready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.\\n\\nI return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting\\n\\non three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger\\n\\nnumber of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so wellin these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion\\n\\nto express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious.\\n\\nThe President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed,\\n\\nand many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about\\n\\nthe missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would\\n\\nsay about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some\\n\\nday, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in\\n\\npositions where honor required no further resistance from them.\\n\\nAgainst this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy.\\n\\nBut our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the\\n\\nopening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns -- nearly one\\n\\nthousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This\\n\\nloss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not\\n\\nbeen proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British\\n\\nExpeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment\\n\\nwhich were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of all\\n\\nthat our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be,\\n\\nhow long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of\\n\\nwhich has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night\\n\\nand day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and\\n\\ncustoms and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward.\\n\\nThere is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has\\n\\ncome upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.\\n\\nNevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have\\n\\npassed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France\\n\\nand Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army\\n\\nhas been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone,\\n\\nmany valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy\\'s possession, the whole of the\\n\\nChannel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must\\n\\nexpect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler\\n\\nhas a plan for invading the British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at\\n\\nBoulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone.\\n\\n\"There are bitter weeds in England.\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the British\\n\\nExpeditionary Force returned.\\n\\nThe whole question of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that\\n\\nwe have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have\\n\\never had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not continue. We shall not be content\\n\\nwith a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British\\n\\nExpeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in\\n\\ntrain; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organization\\n\\nthat the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest\\n\\npossible potential of offensive effort may be realized. On this we are now engaged. It will be very\\n\\nconvenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the\\n\\ngovernment would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to\\n\\nhave our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day\\n\\nby the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House\\n\\nby Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some\\n\\nrequest is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty\\'s\\n\\nGovernment.\\n\\nWe have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens\\n\\nand suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a\\n\\ndanger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great\\n\\nmany people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi\\n\\nGermany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress,\\n\\ndraw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce\\n\\nfighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way,\\n\\nfor their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the\\n\\nslightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a\\n\\nstrong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House,\\n\\nwithout the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in\\n\\nour midst has been effectively stamped out.\\n\\nTurning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that\\n\\nthere has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute\\n\\nguarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the\\n\\ndays of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might\\n\\nhave driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has\\n\\nexcited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told.\\n\\nWe are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the\\n\\ningenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind\\n\\nof novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so\\n\\noutlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope,\\n\\nwith a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to\\n\\nair power if it can be locally exercised.\\n\\nI have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best\\n\\narrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend\\n\\nour Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for\\n\\nyears, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His\\n\\nMajesty\\'s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British\\n\\nEmpire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the\\n\\ndeath their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even\\n\\nthough large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of\\n\\nthe Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the\\n\\nend, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing\\n\\nconfidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we\\n\\nshall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the\\n\\nstreets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment\\n\\nbelieve, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the\\n\\nseas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God\\'s good time,\\n\\nthe New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.'),\n",

American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.\\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.\\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.\\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.\\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.\\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.\\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.\\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.\\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.\\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.\\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.\\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy.

A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy.

It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.\\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.\\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room.\\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind.\\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.\\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year than ever before in the history of America.\\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.\\n\\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.\\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.\\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\\n\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\\n\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that.\\n\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.\\n\\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen.\\n\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks.\\n\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade.\\n\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.\\n\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.\\n\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.\\n\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\\n\\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.\\n\\n4,000 projects have already been announced.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\\n\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.\\n\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure.\\n\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses.\\n\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.\\n\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.\\n\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors.\\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\\n\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it.\\n\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.\\n\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs.\\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives.\\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent.\\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning.\\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.\\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.\\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.\\n\\nAnd we will really take off.\\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone.\\n\\nThere’s something happening in America.\\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story.\\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.\\n\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.\\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\\n\\nIt’s time.\\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.\\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.\\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\\n\\nLook at cars.\\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up.\\n\\nSo—we have a choice.\\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation.\\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages.\\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America.\\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America.\\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\\n\\nI call it building a better America.\\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:\\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.\\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.\\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.\\n\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.\\n\\nAll of these will lower costs.\\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.\\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.\\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.\\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.\\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.\\n\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.\\n\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.\\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.\\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.\\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.\\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.\\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.\\n\\nThat ends on my watch.\\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.\\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.\\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.\\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.\\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\\n\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.\\n\\nBut I also know this.\\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.\\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines.\\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.\\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.\\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19.\\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.\\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.\\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children.\\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.\\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.\\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.\\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.\\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week.\\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.\\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.\\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.\\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.\\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.\\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.\\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money.\\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.\\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.\\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation.\\n\\nAnd we won’t stop.\\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.\\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.\\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.\\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old.\\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22.\\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.\\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time.\\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.\\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.\\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.\\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.\\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?\\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued.\\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault.\\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.\\n\\nWe cannot let this happen.\\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.\\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.\\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours.\\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.\\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\\n\\nThird, support our veterans.\\n\\nVeterans are the best of us.\\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\\n\\nI know.\\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\\n\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\\n\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\\n\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.\\n\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\\n\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\\n\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\\n\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\\n\\nTonight, Danielle—we are.\\n\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\\n\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.\\n\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.\\n\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.\\n\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.\\n\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\\n\\nMore support for patients and families.\\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.\\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.\\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more.\\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation.\\n\\nWe can do this.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy.\\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.\\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\\n\\nNow is the hour.\\n\\nOur moment of responsibility.\\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\n\\nWe will meet the test.\\n\\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.\\n\\nWe will save democracy.\\n\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\\n\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp.\\n\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.\\n\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.\\n\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\\n\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union.\\n\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong.\\n\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago.\\n\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\\n\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\\n\\nAnd we will, as one people.\\n\\nOne America.\\n\\nThe United States of America.\\n\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.')]"

      "We Shall Fight on the Beaches\n",
      "June 4, 1940\n",
      "House of Commons\n",
      "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the\n",
      "second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and\n",
      "French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was\n",
      "not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\n",
      "the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\n",
      "involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\n",
      "abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\n",
      "penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\n",
      "command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in\n",
      "Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly\n",
      "created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n",
      "However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\n",
      "the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different\n",
      "kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off\n",
      "all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\n",
      "food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\n",
      "way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and\n",
      "mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there\n",
      "plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people,\n",
      "always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\n",
      "have never known in their own.\n",
      "I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and\n",
      "Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\n",
      "then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\n",
      "Victoria's Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand\n",
      "strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned\n",
      "the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which\n",
      "marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the\n",
      "Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At\n",
      "least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories\n",
      "of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be\n",
      "held by the French troops.\n",
      "Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\n",
      "the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\n",
      "remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\n",
      "surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were\n",
      "pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\n",
      "When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\n",
      "feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I\n",
      "thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the\n",
      "British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field\n",
      "or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\n",
      "tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole\n",
      "root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to\n",
      "build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or\n",
      "to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\n",
      "That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to\n",
      "fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and\n",
      "his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the\n",
      "late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and\n",
      "British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at\n",
      "the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid,\n",
      "and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong,\n",
      "guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\n",
      "consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own\n",
      "personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed\n",
      "our whole flank and means of retreat.\n",
      "I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not\n",
      "feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.\n",
      "The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the\n",
      "sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared\n",
      "the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in\n",
      "doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see,\n",
      "contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army,\n",
      "who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of\n",
      "Allied troops could reach the coast.\n",
      "The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power\n",
      "of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk\n",
      "and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy\n",
      "began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.\n",
      "They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft,\n",
      "sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that\n",
      "remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats,\n",
      "one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began.\n",
      "For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of\n",
      "them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve\n",
      "to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They\n",
      "had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of\n",
      "bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves\n",
      "free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little\n",
      "or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing\n",
      "with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure\n",
      "of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British\n",
      "and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and\n",
      "women on board them never faltered in their duty.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range\n",
      "would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at\n",
      "the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was\n",
      "protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but\n",
      "only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by\n",
      "perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to\n",
      "us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly\n",
      "handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main\n",
      "strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the\n",
      "Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the\n",
      "jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must\n",
      "be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\n",
      "evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by\n",
      "the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only\n",
      "the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much\n",
      "talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.\n",
      "This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a\n",
      "greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible,\n",
      "and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have\n",
      "been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war\n",
      "than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the\n",
      "Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large\n",
      "formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on\n",
      "several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have\n",
      "dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was\n",
      "driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more\n",
      "ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have\n",
      "been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\n",
      "When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island\n",
      "against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and\n",
      "reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army\n",
      "was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of\n",
      "armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill\n",
      "and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the\n",
      "history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall\n",
      "back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard\n",
      "their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and\n",
      "shattering power, of whom it may be said that\n",
      "Every morn brought forth a noble chance\n",
      "And every chance brought forth a noble knight,\n",
      "deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are\n",
      "ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.\n",
      "I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting\n",
      "on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger\n",
      "number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so wellin these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion\n",
      "to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious.\n",
      "The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed,\n",
      "and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about\n",
      "the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would\n",
      "say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some\n",
      "day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in\n",
      "positions where honor required no further resistance from them.\n",
      "Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy.\n",
      "But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the\n",
      "opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns -- nearly one\n",
      "thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This\n",
      "loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not\n",
      "been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment\n",
      "which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of all\n",
      "that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be,\n",
      "how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of\n",
      "which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night\n",
      "and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and\n",
      "customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward.\n",
      "There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has\n",
      "come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.\n",
      "Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have\n",
      "passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France\n",
      "and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army\n",
      "has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone,\n",
      "many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy's possession, the whole of the\n",
      "Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must\n",
      "expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler\n",
      "has a plan for invading the British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at\n",
      "Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone.\n",
      "\"There are bitter weeds in England.\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force returned.\n",
      "The whole question of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that\n",
      "we have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have\n",
      "ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not continue. We shall not be content\n",
      "with a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British\n",
      "Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in\n",
      "train; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organization\n",
      "that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest\n",
      "possible potential of offensive effort may be realized. On this we are now engaged. It will be very\n",
      "convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the\n",
      "government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to\n",
      "have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day\n",
      "by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House\n",
      "by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some\n",
      "request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty's\n",
      "Government.\n",
      "We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens\n",
      "and suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a\n",
      "danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great\n",
      "many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi\n",
      "Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress,\n",
      "draw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce\n",
      "fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way,\n",
      "for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the\n",
      "slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a\n",
      "strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House,\n",
      "without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in\n",
      "our midst has been effectively stamped out.\n",
      "Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that\n",
      "there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute\n",
      "guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the\n",
      "days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might\n",
      "have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has\n",
      "excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told.\n",
      "We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the\n",
      "ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind\n",
      "of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so\n",
      "outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope,\n",
      "with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to\n",
      "air power if it can be locally exercised.\n",
      "I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best\n",
      "arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend\n",
      "our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for\n",
      "years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His\n",
      "Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British\n",
      "Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the\n",
      "death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even\n",
      "though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of\n",
      "the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the\n",
      "end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing\n",
      "confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we\n",
      "shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the\n",
      "streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment\n",
      "believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the\n",
      "seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time,\n",
      "the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old. \n",

      "\n",

      "I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about connecting the dots.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?\n",
      "\n",
      "It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second story is about love and loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "My third story is about death.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\n",
      "\n",
      "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\n",

      "It’s time. \n",

      "But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \n",
      "\n",
      "When factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look at cars. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \n",
      "\n",
      "And guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \n",
      "\n",
      "So—we have a choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a better plan to fight inflation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lower your costs, not your wages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Make more cars and semiconductors in America. \n",
      "\n",
      "More infrastructure and innovation in America. \n",

      "\n",
      "More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \n",

      "Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I call it building a better America. \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \n",
      "\n",
      "17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \n",
      "\n",
      "First – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Joshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Drug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All of these will lower costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "And under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \n",
      "\n",
      "The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \n",
      "\n",
      "But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "When corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \n",
      "\n",
      "We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That ends on my watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \n",
      "\n",
      "And let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \n",
      "\n",
      "For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I also know this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \n",
      "we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \n",
      "\n",
      "And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
      "\n",
      "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n",
      "\n",
      "And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n",
      "\n",
      "We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, continuing this costs money. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will soon send Congress a request. \n",
      "\n",
      "The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we won’t stop. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n",
      "\n",
      "Officer Mora was 27 years old. \n",
      "\n",
      "Officer Rivera was 22. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve worked on these issues a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n",
      "\n",
      "Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n",
      "\n",
      "These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \n",
      "\n",
      "In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot let this happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \n",
      "\n",
      "A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \n",
      "\n",
      "Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get it done once and for all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \n",
      "\n",
      "The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \n",
      "\n",
      "And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, beat the opioid epidemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \n",
      "\n",
      "And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, support our veterans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Veterans are the best of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \n",
      "\n",
      "My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \n",
      "\n",

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis · Deep Learning · Layout Analysis\\n· Character Recognition · Open Source library · Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [11,\\narXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021'),\n",

Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3 model = lp. Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4 \"lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \")\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.'),\n",

Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\\nthe results into other pipelines.

Shen et al.\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score 16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances 17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate ﬁne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.'),\n",

Many previous works [ 26, 30, 27]\\nand tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\nfor born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [ 12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [ 38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\\nout model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\\nsimpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\\nand a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n18 https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula'),\n",
