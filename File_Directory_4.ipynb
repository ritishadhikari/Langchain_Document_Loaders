      "second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and\n",
      "French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was\n",
      "not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\n",
      "the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\n",
      "involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\n",
      "abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\n",
      "penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\n",
      "command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in\n",
      "Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly\n",
      "created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n",
      "However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\n",
      "the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different\n",
      "kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off\n",
      "all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\n",
      "food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\n",
      "way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and\n",
      "mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there\n",
      "plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people,\n",
      "always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\n",
      "have never known in their own.\n",
      "I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and\n",
      "Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\n",
      "then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\n",
      "Victoria's Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand\n",
      "strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned\n",
      "the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which\n",
      "marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the\n",
      "Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At\n",
      "least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British\n",

      "of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be\n",
      "held by the French troops.\n",
      "Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\n",
      "the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\n",
      "remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\n",
      "surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were\n",
      "pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\n",
      "When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\n",
      "feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I\n",
      "thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the\n",
      "British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field\n",
      "or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\n",
      "tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole\n",
      "root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to\n",
      "build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or\n",
      "to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\n",
      "That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to\n",
      "fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and\n",
      "his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the\n",
      "late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and\n",
      "British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at\n",
      "the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid,\n",
      "and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong,\n",
      "guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\n",
      "consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own\n",
      "personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed\n",
      "our whole flank and means of retreat.\n",
      "I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not\n",
      "feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.\n",
      "The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the\n",
      "sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared\n",
      "the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in\n",
      "doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see,\n",
      "contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army,\n",
      "who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of\n",
      "Allied troops could reach the coast.\n",
      "The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power\n",
      "of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk\n",
      "and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy\n",
      "began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.\n",
      "They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft,\n",
      "sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that\n",
      "remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats,\n",
      "one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began.\n",
      "For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of\n",
      "them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve\n",
      "to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They\n",
      "had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of\n",
      "bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves\n",
      "free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little\n",
      "or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing\n",
      "with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure\n",
      "of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British\n",
      "and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and\n",
      "women on board them never faltered in their duty.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range\n",
      "would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at\n",
      "the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was\n",
      "protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but\n",
      "only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by\n",
      "perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to\n",
      "us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly\n",
      "handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main\n",
      "strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the\n",
      "Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the\n",
      "jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must\n",
      "be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\n",
      "evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by\n",
      "the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only\n",
      "the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much\n",
      "talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.\n",
      "This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a\n",
      "greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible,\n",
      "and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have\n",
      "been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war\n",
      "than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the\n",
      "Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large\n",
      "formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on\n",
      "several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have\n",
      "dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was\n",
      "driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more\n",
      "ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have\n",
      "been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\n",
      "When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island\n",
      "against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and\n",
      "reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army\n",
      "was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of\n",
      "armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill\n",
      "and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the\n",
      "history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall\n",
      "back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard\n",
      "their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and\n",
      "shattering power, of whom it may be said that\n",
      "Every morn brought forth a noble chance\n",
      "And every chance brought forth a noble knight,\n",
      "deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are\n",
      "ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.\n",
      "I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting\n",
      "on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger\n",
      "number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so wellin these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion\n",
      "to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious.\n",
      "The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed,\n",
      "and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about\n",
      "the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would\n",
      "say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some\n",
      "day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in\n",
      "positions where honor required no further resistance from them.\n",

      "convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the\n",
      "government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to\n",
      "have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day\n",
      "by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House\n",
      "by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some\n",
      "request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty's\n",
      "Government.\n",

      "I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about connecting the dots.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?\n",
      "\n",
      "It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second story is about love and loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "My third story is about death.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\n",
      "\n",
      "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\n",

      "\n",
      "17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \n",
      "\n",
      "First – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Joshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Drug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All of these will lower costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "And under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \n",
      "\n",
      "The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \n",
      "\n",
      "But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "When corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \n",
      "\n",
      "We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That ends on my watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \n",
      "\n",
      "And let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \n",
      "\n",
      "For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \n",

      "\n",
      "But I also know this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \n",
      "we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \n",
      "\n",
      "And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
      "\n",
      "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n",
      "\n",
      "And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n",
      "\n",
      "We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n",

      "I will soon send Congress a request. \n",

      "The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we won’t stop. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n",
      "\n",
      "Officer Mora was 27 years old. \n",
      "\n",
      "Officer Rivera was 22. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve worked on these issues a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n",
      "\n",
      "Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n",
      "\n",
      "These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \n",
      "\n",
      "In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot let this happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \n",
      "\n",
      "A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \n",
      "\n",
      "Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get it done once and for all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \n",
      "\n",
      "The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \n",
      "\n",
      "And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, beat the opioid epidemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \n",
      "\n",
      "And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, support our veterans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Veterans are the best of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \n",
      "\n",
      "My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \n",
      "\n",
      "A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \n",
      "\n",
      "Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \n",
      "\n",
      "The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \n",
      "\n",
      "Heath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, Danielle—we are. \n",
      "\n",
      "The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \n",
      "\n",
      "And tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \n",
      "\n",
      "And fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \n",
      "the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \n",
      "\n",
      "More support for patients and families. \n",
      "\n",
      "To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "ARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "A unity agenda for the nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n",
      "\n",
      "And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now is the hour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our moment of responsibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well I know this nation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We will meet the test. \n",
      "\n",
      "To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will save democracy. \n",
      "\n",
      "As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because I see the future that is within our grasp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "So on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \n",
      "\n",
      "And my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are stronger today than we were a year ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will, as one people. \n",
      "\n",
      "One America. \n",
