Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conÔ¨Ågurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neÔ¨Äorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ¬∑ Deep Learning ¬∑ Layout Analysis\\n¬∑ Character Recognition ¬∑ Open Source library ¬∑ Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiÔ¨Åcation [11,\\narXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021'),\n",

Shen et al.\\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [ 26], and scene text detection [ 4].\\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\\nmanual speciÔ¨Åcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneÔ¨Åt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical diÔ¨Éculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneÔ¨Åt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-Ô¨Çedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand Ô¨Åne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the Ô¨Ånal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diÔ¨Écult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiÔ¨Åcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniÔ¨Åed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1. An oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf usage\\n3. Comprehensive tools for eÔ¨Écient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diÔ¨Äerent levels of customization\\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriÔ¨Åcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneÔ¨Åt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eÔ¨Äorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show\\nLayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects'),\n",

The dhSegment [ 22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniÔ¨Åed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [ 15] and the DeepDIVA project [ 2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\\nRecent years have also seen numerous eÔ¨Äorts to create libraries for promoting\\nreproducibility and reusability in the Ô¨Åeld of DL.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. DiÔ¨Äerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3 model = lp. Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4 \"lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \")\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diÔ¨Äerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diÔ¨Äerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.'),\n",

Shen et al.\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identiÔ¨Åed and rectiÔ¨Åed via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The Ô¨Çexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diÔ¨Äerent glyphs, which signiÔ¨Åcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special Ô¨Çat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nÔ¨Çexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eÔ¨Äort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiÔ¨Åes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score 16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances 17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate Ô¨Åne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.'),\n",

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conÔ¨Ågurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neÔ¨Äorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ¬∑ Deep Learning ¬∑ Layout Analysis\\n¬∑ Character Recognition ¬∑ Open Source library ¬∑ Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiÔ¨Åcation [11,\\narXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021'),\n",

Shen et al.\\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [ 26], and scene text detection [ 4].\\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\\nmanual speciÔ¨Åcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneÔ¨Åt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical diÔ¨Éculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneÔ¨Åt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-Ô¨Çedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand Ô¨Åne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the Ô¨Ånal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diÔ¨Écult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiÔ¨Åcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniÔ¨Åed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1. An oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf usage\\n3. Comprehensive tools for eÔ¨Écient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diÔ¨Äerent levels of customization\\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriÔ¨Åcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneÔ¨Åt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eÔ¨Äorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show\\nLayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects'),\n",

The dhSegment [ 22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniÔ¨Åed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [ 15] and the DeepDIVA project [ 2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\\nRecent years have also seen numerous eÔ¨Äorts to create libraries for promoting\\nreproducibility and reusability in the Ô¨Åeld of DL.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. DiÔ¨Äerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3 model = lp. Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4 \"lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \")\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diÔ¨Äerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diÔ¨Äerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.'),\n",

Shen et al.\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identiÔ¨Åed and rectiÔ¨Åed via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The Ô¨Çexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diÔ¨Äerent glyphs, which signiÔ¨Åcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special Ô¨Çat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nÔ¨Çexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eÔ¨Äort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiÔ¨Åes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score 16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances 17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate Ô¨Åne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.'),\n",

       "'LayoutParser: A UniÔ¨Åed Toolkit for Deep\\nLearning Based Document Image Analysis\\nZejiang Shen1 (\\x00 ), Ruochen Zhang2, Melissa Dell3, Benjamin Charles Germain\\nLee4, Jacob Carlson3, and Weining Li5\\n1 Allen Institute for AI\\nshannons@allenai.org\\n2 Brown University\\nruochen zhang@brown.edu\\n3 Harvard University\\n{melissadell,jacob carlson}@fas.harvard.edu\\n4 University of Washington\\nbcgl@cs.washington.edu\\n5 University of Waterloo\\nw422li@uwaterloo.ca\\nAbstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conÔ¨Ågurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neÔ¨Äorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ¬∑ Deep Learning ¬∑ Layout Analysis\\n¬∑ Character Recognition ¬∑ Open Source library ¬∑ Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiÔ¨Åcation [11,\\narXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021'"
